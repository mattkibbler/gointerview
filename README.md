# gointerview

A small program to rehearse potential interview questions and practice using Go.

## What?

A command line program which prompts the user with random pre-loaded questions and records their answer. After answering the user is shown the correct answer and asked to mark their own work - did they get it right or wrong. In the future I would like to integrate ChatGPT or some other AI to have this done automatically.

## Roadmap

With the foundation now in place I will look at tackle the following...

- [x] Add a database to store questions as well as record the user's answers.
- [x] Categories to request questions of a particular type.
- [ ] Make it look nicer... add fancy colours?
- [ ] Integrate AI to verify answers and maybe generate new ones on the fly.
